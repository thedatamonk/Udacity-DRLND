# Udacity Deep Reinforcement learning Nanodegree
## Problem statement
In this project, we have to train an agent to navigate (and collect bananas!) in a large, square world. This environment is provided by Unity Machine Learning agents (ML-agents). We are free to use any value-based methods that were taught in the course.

## Environment
The **state space** has `37` dimensions each of which is a continuous variable. It includes the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around the agent's forward direction.
The **action space** contains the following `4` legal actions: 
- move forward `0`
- move backward `1`
- turn left `2`
- turn right `3`

A reward of `+1` is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of `-1` is provided for collecting a blue banana. Thus, the goal of the agent is to collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas.
The task is **episodic**, and in order to solve the environment, your agent must get an average score of `+13` over `100` consecutive episodes.
